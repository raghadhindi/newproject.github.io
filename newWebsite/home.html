            <h1>Arab cuisine</h1>
            <p class="p1"> (Arabic: المطبخ العربي‎) is the cuisine of the Arabs, defined as the various regional cuisines spanning the Arab world, from the Maghreb to the Fertile Crescent and the Arabian Peninsula.[1] These cuisines are centuries old and reflect the culture of trading in spices, herbs, and foods. The regions have many similarities, but also unique traditions. They have also been influenced by climate, cultivation, and mutual commerce.</p>
            <p class="p1">The Middle East incorporates the Fertile Crescent, including the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia) where wheat was first cultivated, followed by rye, barley, lentils, beans, pistachios, figs, pomegranates, dates and other regional staples.[3] The domestication of sheep, goats and cattle took place in the region as well. Fermentation was also discovered there, in order to leaven bread and make beer in Mesopotamia and the Levant. Additionally, the earliest written recipes come from that region.

            <p>The small version of this Jordanian and Palestinian dish looks like a pizza covered with a lamb carcass, while a larger banquet variety can cover a whole table.
